    <p>According to the popular legend, the pizza Margherita was invented in 1889 by Raffaele Esposito, chef at Pizzeria Brandi. The pizza was allegedly created in honor of Italy's unification, with the three toppings—basil, mozzarella, and tomato—respectively representing the green, white, and red of the Italian flag.</p>
